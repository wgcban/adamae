# *Ada*MAE: Adaptive Masking for Efficient Spatiotemporal Learning with Masked Autoencoders

We propose \adamae, a novel, adaptive, and end-to-end trainable token sampling strategy for MAEs that takes into account the spatiotemporal properties of all input tokens to sample fewer but informative tokens.
